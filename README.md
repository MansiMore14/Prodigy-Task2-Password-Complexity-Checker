Project Title: Password-Complexity-Checker

The "check-password-strength" project is a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of passwords provided by users. It assesses multiple factors to ensure passwords meet key security criteria, thereby promoting better cybersecurity practices.

Functionality:

Password Length: The script verifies that the password meets a minimum length requirement, set at 8 characters.
Uppercase Letters: It checks for the presence of at least one uppercase letter in the password.
Lowercase Letters: The script ensures that the password includes at least one lowercase letter.
Numbers: It confirms that the password contains at least one numeric character.
Special Characters: The script verifies that the password includes at least one special character from a set of predefined symbols (!@#$%^&*()-+=).

Strength Assessment:

Feedback: Based on the evaluation, the script provides immediate feedback on the passwordâ€™s strength.
Weak Passwords: If any criteria are not met, the password is classified as "Weak," and the unmet requirements are specifically highlighted.
Strong Passwords: When all criteria are satisfied, the password is classified as "Strong," indicating it meets essential security standards.

Usage:

Input: Users execute the script and are prompted to enter their desired password.
Evaluation: After submission, the script assesses the password according to the established criteria.
Feedback: Users receive instant feedback on their password strength and guidance on how to improve it if necessary.

Purpose:

Password Assessment: This tool provides users with a straightforward method to gauge the strength of their passwords quickly.
Educational Tool: It educates users about crucial password security practices by emphasizing the characteristics of a robust password.
Enhanced Security: By encouraging the creation of stronger passwords, the script contributes to improved overall cybersecurity awareness and practices
